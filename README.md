# Little Treat Tracker V.0

This project was built on top of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.

## About

:construction: WIP

A basic, silly webapp to track and count all your little treats, built up from Angular's first app tutorial.

Users can save the following data for each treat:
- treat title
- price of the treat
- when the treat was bought
- where the treat came from
- an optional note

## Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Contents

Uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) for things like datePicker, form, and inputs. Price input uses [InputMask](https://github.com/ngneat/input-mask).
